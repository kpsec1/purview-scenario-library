.SYNOPSIS
    Removes (or disables) the "Adaptive Protection - Teams and Exchange DLP (Custom)" DLP policy.

.DESCRIPTION
    Two rollback modes:
      -Disable (default, recommended first step): sets the policy Mode to Disable. Reversible in
       seconds via Set-DlpCompliancePolicy -Mode Enable. No history is lost.
      -Purge: permanently deletes the policy and its two rules via Remove-DlpCompliancePolicy.
       Removing the policy also removes its rules (Microsoft Learn: remove-dlpcompliancepolicy).
       This is NOT reversible - re-deploying requires re-running
       New-AdaptiveProtectionDlpPolicy.ps1.

    This script only rolls back the DLP policy this scenario deploys. It does not disable
    Adaptive Protection itself, the feeder Insider Risk Management policy, or any Conditional
    Access / Data Lifecycle Management policy - all outside this scenario's scope (design.md
    Section 7).

    Idempotent: if the policy does not exist, the script reports that and exits cleanly rather
    than erroring.

.PARAMETER PolicyName
    Name of the DLP policy to roll back. Must match the -PolicyName used at deploy time.

.PARAMETER Purge
    Permanently delete the policy instead of disabling it. See rollback.md for the recommended
    disable-first, purge-later sequence.

.PARAMETER WhatIf
    Standard PowerShell ShouldProcess dry-run - reports the disable/removal that would happen
    without calling Set-DlpCompliancePolicy / Remove-DlpCompliancePolicy.

.EXAMPLE
    Connect-IPPSSession -AppId $AppId -Certificate $Cert -Organization $TenantDomain
    ./Remove-AdaptiveProtectionDlpPolicy.ps1 -WhatIf

.EXAMPLE
    ./Remove-AdaptiveProtectionDlpPolicy.ps1
    # Disables the policy (soft rollback).

.EXAMPLE
    ./Remove-AdaptiveProtectionDlpPolicy.ps1 -Purge
    # Permanently deletes the policy and its rules.
